# Click-Through-Rate-Prediction
 Improve online ad targeting and decision-making by predicting Click-Through Rates (CTR) using machine learning, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, along with data preprocessing and feature engineering.
 
# Project Objective
Create precise CTR prediction models to guide ad selection, audience targeting, and strategic ad placement. This empowers marketers to optimize ad placement for better engagement, considering factors like product competition and device preferences.

# Approach
We've employed a range of machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to predict CTR. These models underwent training and assessment using both balanced and imbalanced datasets to gauge their performance across various scenarios.

# Utilized Libraries

pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
numpy: Mathematical array operations
seaborn: Data visualization
matplotlib.pyplot: Graph plotting
warnings: Control warning messages
sklearn: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics
imblearn: Managing imbalanced datasets
statsmodels: Statistical modeling and analysis
category_encoders: Encoding categorical features

# Outcomes
Model performance, encompassing accuracy, recall, precision, and cross-validation scores, is consolidated into a summary table. We present each model's performance on both training and test datasets, accompanied by the mean cross-validation score.

# Application
This repository serves as a valuable reference for implementing CTR prediction models within online advertising. It equips marketing professionals and data scientists with insights into model effectiveness, aiding in informed ad placement decisions.
